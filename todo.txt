Final Report

1. Prepare and submit a final document that includes the previous five chapters and
presents in Chapter 6 your overall experiences and what you learned during the
execution of this project. This will be a professional-grade document with a title page,
table of contents, introduction, full explanation of the testing framework, detailed
instructions, examples etc. You can edit together your previous submittals as chapters
in this final report, but be sure it reads as a coherent whole. Include a section at the end
that is a self-evaluation of your team's work. Also include a section that evaluates the
project assignments and provides suggestions for improving them in the future. I will
use your input to improve the delivery of CSCI 462 as well.

2. Prepare and submit a printer-ready poster that presents your project. This poster should
be entered (at your discretion) in the Spring 2020 School of Science and Math Poster
Session.

3. Prepare and submit a presentation file such as powerpoint or Prezi that you will use for
your in-class final presentation. Plan on 20 minutes with each member speaking. Your
presentation should explain your project, your lessons-learned and provide
demonstrations of your framework, passing tests, and fault-injection results. There will
be 5 minutes for questions and discussion following the 20 minute presentation. I will
film the proceedings!
